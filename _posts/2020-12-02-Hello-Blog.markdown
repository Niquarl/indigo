## Summary:

I have "started" a blog.

---

In order to have a little bit more space to communicate on what I want than just Mastodon, I'm officially starting this blog. You should not expect frequent posts from me, after all, I don't have much to say of particular interest. I am not entirely certain what I _will_ be posting about, after all, I only know the first two blog posts I intend to push-to-the-internet. You can subscribe to this blog via RSS from your favourite feed reader to get all new posts if you want.

You can follow me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@niquarl) for more frequent updates. My use of Mastodon varies depending on my mood and free time.

Freely & Peacefully,

*Niquarl*
